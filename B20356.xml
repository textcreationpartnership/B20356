            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Play not having answer'd the Ends of my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, the Reader I presume may reasonably expect that (according to Custom) I shou'd endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that they who dislik'd it are either Fools, or Poets: Now my sole dependance being the Judgment of an Audience, 'twere madness in me to provoke 'em. And I may with more safety, and less trouble, perswade 'em into a good opinion of their sense, than my own. 'Tis dangerous to Quarrel with a whole Town, as 'tis difficult to please 'em; there is no Appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Court, after an Illegal Sentence from them, their Will is Law, and 'tis but reasonable it shou'd be so, since they pay for their Power.</p>
            <p>I am willing to stand to my Prayer in my <hi>Prologue,</hi> and to acknowledge it has had a Favourable Fate: I intended (but I had some considerable Hinderances, which the Reader shall know presently) to have made the Town some amends in this Play for their Extraordinary Favours to my First: For I am so far from that vanity of thinking my self Considerable enough to have receiv'd any Prejudice from my Enemies, that I am ready to acknowledge 'twas want of Merit in the Play, not understanding in its Audience, that made it meet with no Kinder Reception. All I propose is to lay down some Excuses why it is not more deserving. But tho' I am ready to confess its defects, yet I wou'd willingly be thought able to mend them.
<pb facs="tcp:204870:3"/> My first Hindrance was my want of time; for rather than lose a Winter (the Profits of my other being so considerable) I forc'd my self to invent a Fable: Now my first was Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and consequently more easie: The one was the Kindly Product of my Fancy, this of my Judgment: (I mean of that little judgment I have) That was a Cherry gather'd in <hi>July;</hi> this was meerly ripned by Artifice in <hi>April,</hi> 'twill hardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Dispute, which must of consequence have the more Natural and Pleasing Taste.</p>
            <p>Another Hindrance was my too nice observation of Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (which tho' I pretend not exactly to have follow'd, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I am something nearer than most of our late Comedies) the Scene never breaking in any Act but the Third, and then not to an unreasonable distance, nor without a necessitous Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: The time I think is obviously comprehended in five Hours. But this Confinement is a great Hinderance to Variety of Incidents, which provided they are natural after they are brought in, I think may very reasonably divert us, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving that strictness. And tho' I am ready to grant that a good Play is much the better for being Regular, yet on the other side, it must be allow'd a Double Art and Labour to make it both Regular and Diverting, and of the two, truly I don't see but men of the greatest sense had rather have their Fancies pleas'd, than their judgment; and I can't help Wishing, tho' too late, that I had given a looser Rein to the former.</p>
            <p>Another inconvenience was, that during the time of my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the two first Acts, I was entertain'd in the New Theatre, and of course prepar'd my Characters to the taste of those Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and they having the two most Experienc'd, I might there (without discouraging the People of this House) have expected a more Masterly Performance. In the middle of my Writing the Third Act, not liking my Station there, I return'd again
<pb facs="tcp:204870:3"/> to the Theatre Royal, and was then forc'd, as far as I cou'd with nature, to confine the Business of my Persons to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of different people, and not to miss the Advantage of Mr. <hi>Doggett</hi>'s Excellent Action; I prepar'd a low Character, which (tho' I dare not recommend it to the Reader) I knew from him cou'd not fail of Diverting; I have seen him Play with more success I own, but ne're saw any Man wear a truer face of Nature; and indeed the two last Acts were much better perform'd than I cou'd have propos'd in that other House; the difference is only this, had it been there I had propos'd some Scenes more of a Piece with the former Acts: But however, the performance of the whole was better than my Expectation from so thin, and I may add so uncertain a Company: For we are no more sure of the Honest Endeavours of some that are Honestly paid, than they are of Bread when they leave us: I was forc'd to Write to the Mouths of those I knew wou'd speak as well as they cou'd, and not think themselves above Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Every one did their best, and I thank 'em: But however a Fort is in a very poor condition, that (in a time of General War) has but an handful of Raw young Fellows to maintain it.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <l>MOST Authors, when their barren Labours fail,</l>
            <l>Still let their secret Vanity prevail;</l>
            <l>And when they're damn'd by you, turn Wits, and rail.</l>
            <l>'Tis not, say they, our writing well or ill,</l>
            <l>But as the Town's i'th' mood, of damning still;</l>
            <l>Sense, Humour, Wit, and Plot, tho' ne'er so nice,</l>
            <l>All take the Tincture from their vain Caprice:</l>
            <l>Their weak Digestion, and their Sickly Tast,</l>
            <l>Nauseates this Hour, what feasted 'em the last.</l>
            <l>Our generous Soul now's of another Mind,</l>
            <l>He thinks you are to Mercy well inclin'd;</l>
            <l>Show you a Beauty, and you'll soon be kind.</l>
            <l>Nor do you care from whence the Charmer springs,</l>
            <l>Let her soft Voice but please you while she sings.</l>
            <l>By blest Experience this our Author knows,</l>
            <l>Tho' from the Stage his humble Muse arose.</l>
            <l>Your Approbation was so kindly shown,</l>
            <l>It swell'd so high,—you swore 'twas not his own.</l>
            <l>But tho' it were, you still thought fit to spare</l>
            <l>The Tree, for what it might hereafter bear;</l>
            <l>Nor damn'd the Poet for the worthless Player.</l>
            <l>This Thought confirms him, if he fails you now,</l>
            <l>He must his Fate to want of Merit owe,</l>
            <l>And thinks the greatest Merit is in pleasing you.</l>
            <l>You'll pay him well, if you approve the Feast,</l>
            <l>And you are sure best Judges of your Tast;</l>
            <l>If he can please—</l>

            <l>YOƲR Servant Gentlemen, I am come to try</l>
            <l>What I can do to save this Comedy:</l>
            <l>'Twere hard shou'd a refusal be my hap,</l>
            <l>When all I ask, is but a harmless clap.</l>
            <l>A single Critick I'd not fear to mawle,</l>
            <l>A Look wou'd soon make one his doom recall;</l>
            <l>But what am I (poor thing) among you all?</l>
            <l>Well! I'm engag'd i'th' Cause, and must go through it;</l>
            <l>You are but Men, and therefore I'll pursue it.</l>
            <l>I've heard there are some Ladies of the Stage,</l>
            <l>That cock their Eyes, and dare a Criticks Rage:</l>
            <l>Now I wou'd fain by gentle softness move you;</l>
            <l>Ah! Jesu!—How a clap wou'd make me love you.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Beaux</hi> will be kind, I see it in their Features,</l>
            <l>They are of such tender, melting Natures;</l>
            <l>Look now! Were ever seen such lovely Creatures?</l>
            <l>Heaven's! How their Smiles become 'em! O! such Graces!</l>
            <l>I'll swear a Frown wou'd spoil their pretty Faces.</l>
            <l>Dear Sirs be kind, and let this Play but pass,</l>
            <l>We'll stop at nothing to deserve the Grace,</l>
            <l>We'll hang our Stage all round with Looking-Glass.</l>

                     <p>I grant she is inconstant, loose, and dangerous, as the Sand; yet, his Eye, the false Optick of his Love, presents her as a fixt unshaken Rock whereon he vows to build his Happiness.</p>

At length, my Friendly Arguments brought him to this Conclusion. About an hour hence by his free Consent, I am to visit her, and have leave to feign my self her Lover, and urge my Passion with all the seeming tenderness that Friendship can inspire, and if my Art can drag from her, the least acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Love for me: Or but an ungenerous Contempt of his unwearied Constancy, he vows, his deep Resentment shou'd for ever tear her from his Heart.</p>

                  <sp>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Leo.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay I can't swear, that he has given any certain Proof, for now a days Men offer Marriage, as their Interest directs them, not their love.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Oli.</speaker>
                     <p>I see Women are more vain, than Men are false: Now, Madam, I am concern'd, and I must tell you, you are the last of Womankind cou'd make me so far jealous of Mr. <hi>Longville:</hi> I know the Race of Man wou'd fall, were only he and you alive to raise it.</p>

                     <speaker>Leo.</speaker>
                     <p>I see Vanity, Madam, is a raging Vice among our Sex, and when it meets with a Disappointment, it knaws it self to Envy. <stage>[Scornfully.]</stage>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:204870:40"/> Friend, and griev'd that nothing but my exposing you never cou'd wean him from your Eyes: Now since every Circumstance convinces me, that those Aspersions I now lie under are but the Continuance of your just Revenge, if you'll but clear my Honour by a generous Acknowledgment of what you have done to ruine me; you bind us all to an Eternal Secrecy, and me in any Honourable Command to serve you with my Life.</p>

                     <p>Hold Brother, first let me speak: You are the suspected Criminal, and thus I charge you. — About Two a Clock this Afternoon <hi>Olivia,</hi> and I visited my Lady <hi>Manlove,</hi> where we had a full Account from a Gentleman, of your late Quarrel with my Lord <hi>Lovemore: Leonora</hi> smil'd at our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and to our Amazement, wou'd perswade us, that you were really my Lord's Rival in her Love; adding withal, that you had lately offer'd Marriage to her: Nay, and to give us a more convincing Proof of it; she desir'd, that we wou'd see her write to you, which she did, and show'd us the Letter, wherein she appointed you a Meeting in half an Hour, here, at Mrs. <hi>Siam</hi>'s. — <hi>Olivia,</hi> more out of a sportive Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than to satisfie any jealous Thought, begg'd the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and she likewise appointed you to meet her in the same half Hour at her Father's.</p>

                     <p>The Letters both were sent: But our Amazement yet continues: <hi>Olivia</hi> is disappointed, and we have found you here with <hi>Leonora:</hi> Now, you are free to answer.</p>

                     <p>Faith I begin to be weary of it, and have this very Hour laid a Design to bring the Old Gentleman to a Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble composition: I have Rivall'd him in my Lady <hi>Manlove,</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow'd him out of her Favour, and have at last squeez'd him out of five hundred Pound provided I renounce all Title to her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
